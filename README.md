## Welcome to jsvivero profile page
I am Juan Sebastián Vivero Jáuregui, 21 years old.

Student of Computing and software engineering at Universidad Nacional de Colombia,  I’ve been here since 2013, during this years my learnings lead me to make awesome projects that include games, languages, mash up applications, web applications, stand alone and many others that will be soon in this page.   

## Interests

Since I was a little child everything around computers and software was interesting to me, all I wanna do since there is to be capable of creating my own software with my ideas, my experience, my designs and that’s the reason of my life, having such a power of creation in both  hands to develop whatever is in my mind.

I discovered with my projects that developing software to help  people is motivating and needed so that’s my choice in a near future.

About languages I’ve learned a lot, Java, Ruby, Python, Golang, C, C# , C++,  JavaScript  ……….
Because the logic is the same is easy to learn new languages each time.
